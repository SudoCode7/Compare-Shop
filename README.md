Hey Guys, :-)
This idea had originally struck me when I was constantly looking on various grocery sites to buy groceries.
Searching same thing over and over again, which made me to write this program.
I have compiled 2 programs-

<h3>1. Groceries -</h3> Searches for groceries on Bigbasket, Grofers and Jiomart. (Recursive for any number of products on list)


<h3>2. Product -</h3> Searches for product on Amzazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. (Once)

<h2>Prerequisites-</h2>

<h3>1.Libraries-</h3>
  -Selenium
  -Pyautogui
  -Time

<h3>2.Web Driver-</h3> Just go on google and check your browser version.
-> Copying the version, download your version of web driver from google and paste it in the same folder as of the program.
-> If you are using Edge name it as "MicrosoftWebDriver".
-> Or if you are using Chrome name it as "ChromeDriver".

JUST ENTER IN THE FIELDS WHEREVER ASKED*
