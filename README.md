Hey Guys, :-)
This idea had originally struck me when I was constantly looking on various grocery sites to buy groceries.
Searching same thing over and over again, which made me to write this program.
I have compiled 2 programs-

1. Groceries - Searches for groceries on Bigbasket, Grofers and Jiomart. (Recursive for any number of products on list)

2. Product - Searches for product on Amzazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. (Once)

Prerequisites--

1.Libraries-
  -Selenium
  -Pyautogui
  -time

2.Web Driver- Just go on google and check your browser version.
-> Copying the version, download your version of web driver from google and paste it in the same folder as of the program.
-> If you are using Edge name it as "MicrosoftWebDriver".
-> Or if you are using Chrome name it as "ChromeDriver".

JUST ENTER IN THE FIELDS WHEREVER ASKED*

           ENJOY AND FEEL FREE TO BUY ME A COFFEE
